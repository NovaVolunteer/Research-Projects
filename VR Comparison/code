#The goal of this research is to identify if those that used the vr version of a meditation treatment 
during a break period as compared to a mobile version of the paced breathing exercise experienced 
greater reductions in heartrate readings durning the treatment. 

#H1 Significant differences are present in terms of heartrate reduction for those the used the VR when compared to the mobile app for paced breathing excerises. 

#H0 No significant differences are present in terms of heartrate reduction for those the used the VR when 
compared to the mobile app for paced breathing excerises. 

#First lets just look at some basic stats between the two groups and then we are going to use a simple t-test to 
compared group average differences in heartrate. 

#Start by splitting the dataframe just for ease of analysis. 
#Split our data.frame, seems to work better when we pull out the splitting term from the original data.frame
split <- as.factor(vr_data$UserType)
#run the split
split_vr_data <- split.data.frame(vr_data,split)

#Re-index the data.frame for vr
vr <- data.frame(split_vr_data$vr)
#Re-index the data.frame for mobile

#Just at first glance it looks like on average the VR does reduce the heartrate when compared to the mobile app, 
which actually appears to increase participants heartrate on average.
The users spent about the same amount of time at 199.36 seconds per session for VR and 196.45 for mobile.
